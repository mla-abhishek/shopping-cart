# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

This is a sample React project demonstrating an "Add to Cart" functionality. It fetches product data from the dummy API https://dummyjson.com/products and allows users to add items to the cart dynamically. The project showcases state management and basic UI interactions for a seamless shopping experience.
